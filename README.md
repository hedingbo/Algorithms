# Algorithms
As a beginner in learning algorithms, it is hard to remember all the equations and structures clearly. 

As an old saying goes:" practice makes perfect". This program aims to re-implementing all the algorithms using C language, the final goal is to run correctly and pass all test cases.

Wish me a success.
